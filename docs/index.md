# User Interface
This page could be configured to improve the aesthetic, but I decide to a simple Makefile to a quick test.

# Links
Each link below is to a different test
## A-frame test
[https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example-001.html](https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example-001.html) Only shows 3d Objects that could be moved using a mouse, touch commands or using a VR Headset

## AR.js
[Example002_Marker_Hiro](https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example002_Marker_Hiro "I preferred to hide the whole text of the link") Original code tha shows a t-rex in the marker, all data is outside this repository  
[Example003_Marker_Hiro](https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example003_Marker_Hiro) As the above is working I'm chaning the code on this one  
[Example004_Marker_Hiro](https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example004_Marker_Hiro "Example004_Marker_Hiro") translucid cube in the Hiro, this time the Marker is read in the folder inside this repository
