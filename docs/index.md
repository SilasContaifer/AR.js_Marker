# User Interface
This page could be configured to improve the aesthetic, but I decide to a simple Makefile to a quick test.

# Links
Each link below is to a different test
## A-frame test
[https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example-001.html](https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example-001.html) Only shows 3d Objects that could be moved using a mouse, touch commands or using a VR Headset

## AR.js
[Example002_Marker_Hiro](https://tsulam.github.io/AR.js_Marker/Example002_Marker_Hiro "I preferred to hide the whole text of the link")
